## Dates for the current Winter Semester 2024 / 2025
23.10.2024 **Lavinia Kinne & Virginia Sondergeld**, "Meet My Family: The Effect of Female CEOs’ Newspaper Coverage on CEO Perception and Economic Decision-making"
<p style="font-size:smaller; margin-left:10mm; text-align:justify;">
    The newspaper coverage of CEOs is highly gendered with more family-related language used in newspaper articles on female than male company leaders. In a randomized online experiment, we ask whether this stereotypical representation affects readers' beliefs about CEO competence, firm performance, and resulting financial decision-making. We show participants articles consisting of elements from real newspaper coverage on a real company and its CEO, and vary the way information about their family is (not) presented. We find that although respondents do not believe firm performance to be different by CEO coverage, investments into the firm stock are significantly lower for female CEOs when their family is neutrally mentioned. Instead, there is no penalty for highlighting a trade-off between family and career. Machine-learning analysis based on free-text questions suggests that family and gender play an important role in respondents' reasoning.

06.11.2024 **Carola Stapper**, Job Market Paper, „Consequences of Forced Labor Conscription: Evidence from Dutch Civilians after WWII“
<p style="font-size:smaller; margin-left:10mm; text-align:justify;">
    Disruptions of labor market trajectories have lasting effects on later economic success. Displacement due to forced labor conscription is a disruption that remains understudied despite its continued prevalence in contemporary contexts. I investigate the consequences of exposure to forced labor conscription for individuals' long-term labor market outcomes. I exploit the fact that cohorts of Dutch civilians faced a differential probability of temporary labor coercion in Nazi Germany during WWII in a Regression Discontinuity Design. Using Dutch census data from 1971, I find that conscripted individuals have lower education, income, and probability of employment. Analyzing heterogeneous effects, I find that exposure to harsher conditions in Germany is associated with reduced labor force participation and poorer health. My findings suggest that the negative impact on labor force participation is mitigated when individuals are conscripted to work in sectors that are also present in the Netherlands, which enhances their ability to reintegrate into the workforce.

20.11.2024 **Daniel Graeber**, "Cognitive Abilities and Economic Preferences: Evidence from Genetic and Behavioral Data". (joint work with Tana Maneein and Carsten Schroeder).
<p style="font-size:smaller; margin-left:10mm; text-align:justify;">
    An influential body of economic literature has consistently shown strong associations between cognitive abilities and economic preferences. However, much of this research has overlooked the potential endogeneity of cognitive abilities—an oversight given that these abilities stem from a series of investment decisions influenced by factors likely correlated with economic preferences. To address this gap, we utilize a novel dataset that includes both stated and revealed preferences, along with genetic data on respondents. We measure inherent predispositions to high cognitive abilities using a polygenic score for cognitive performance (PGI CP), providing a robust proxy for individuals’ innate cognitive potential. Our comprehensive data further allow us to mitigate concerns that individuals with a genetic disposition for high cognitive performance are also raised in more favorable environments.

04.12.2024 **Izabela Wnuk-Soares**, Job Market Paper, "Migration and Native Health: New Evidence from the Workplace"
<p style="font-size:smaller; margin-left:10mm; text-align:justify;">
    This paper evaluates the impact of immigration on the incidence of severe health shocks at the workplace level. Using rich linked employer-employee data from Germany and an instrumental variable leveraging policy variation, I show that firms with a higher concentration of foreign workers experience lower rates of long-term sickness among their employees. Decomposing the rates by gender and worker origin reveals that these health improvements are concentrated entirely among native men, are particularly pronounced in medium-sized construction and trade companies, and are driven by the firm's foreign new hires. The primary mechanism is a lower relative participation of native male workers in manual tasks at the firm, particularly in industries with high health risks. Further analysis confirms that these effects are not due to the substitution of less healthy natives, the evolution of norms around absenteeism, differences in firm expansion trends, or reverse causality.

18.12.2024 **Julie Treguier**, "The Effect of Adverse Life-Events on Income Trajectories"
<p style="font-size:smaller; margin-left:10mm; text-align:justify;">
    This paper studies and compares the effect of different adverse life events -- job loss, disability and health shocks, divorce and spousal death -- on individuals' income trajectories. We use a harmonized design across events in terms of methodology and data: matching difference-in-difference with exhaustive Dutch administrative registers. We assess the effect of adverse events on different margins. We compare their effect on primary and disposable household income in order to measure the public insurance to the shocks provided by the tax and transfer system. Both between different events and within different groups for a given event, we find that the importance of government insurance increases with the severity of the shock on primary income. However, we find that certain groups of the population are relatively less protected against adverse life events, such as young people facing a large health shock or secondary earners facing a divorce.
